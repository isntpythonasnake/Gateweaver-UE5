# Gateweaver
**A portal creation kit plugin for Unreal Engine 5.5+**

Gateweaver is a powerful yet simple UE5 plugin that brings seamless "portal" mechanics to any project. Create fully functional gates that allow players to see, move, and interact across different spaces in real time using Render Target. It works right out of the box without fiddling with any settings.

## Features
- Create seamless gate pairs or gates with multiple entry/exit points using simple in-editor configuration.
  - Adjust mesh and texture of gate.
  - Gate type (pair or multiple).
- Gates can be spawned with collisions, object interactions, equipped tools, or point-and-click turrets.
- Allow/disallow types of surfaces where gates may or may not spawn, such as terrain surfaces.
- Objects or collision boxes that deletes gates.
- Add a customisable loading screen for long distance gates.
- Physics are fully translated between gates. Throw an object into one gate and it comes flying out through the other!
